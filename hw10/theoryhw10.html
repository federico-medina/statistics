            <h2>Sample Mean and Variance</h2>
            <p>
                The sample mean and variance are fundamental statistical measures used to summarize data and make inferences about a population. 
                The sample mean, denoted \( \bar{X} \), is computed as:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                In this equation, \( X_i \) represents each individual observation in the sample, and \( n \) is the total number of observations. 
                The sample mean provides an estimate of the population mean, \( \mu \), and serves as a central measure of data distribution.
            </p>

            <p>
                Similarly, the sample variance, denoted \( S^2 \), quantifies the dispersion of data around the mean. It is calculated using:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                This formula ensures that \( S^2 \) serves as an unbiased estimator of the population variance \( \sigma^2 \). 
                As the sample size increases, the sample variance provides a more accurate representation of the true population variance.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Properties of Their Distributions</h3>
            <p>
                One of the essential characteristics of the sample mean is that its expected value equals the population mean, expressed as \( E[\bar{X}] = \mu \). 
                Additionally, the variance of the sample mean decreases with increasing sample size, following the relationship:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                \text{Var}(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                This reduction in variance indicates that larger samples yield more precise estimates of the population mean. 
                Moreover, according to the Central Limit Theorem, for sufficiently large samples, the distribution of the sample mean approximates a normal distribution, regardless of the population’s underlying distribution. 
                This property is fundamental to many statistical inference techniques.
            </p>

            <p>
                The sample variance \( S^2 \) is also a random variable that converges to the true population variance as the sample size grows. 
                It provides crucial insights into the spread and variability of the sample data, complementing the information obtained from the sample mean.
            </p>

            <h2>Lebesgue–Stieltjes Integration</h2>
            <p>
                Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration extends the concept of Riemann integration by allowing integration with respect to a function rather than a single variable. 
                This approach is particularly valuable in probability and measure theory, as it enables the integration of both continuous and discontinuous functions while accommodating mixed discrete-continuous distributions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Formally, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of a function \( f \) with respect to a function \( g \) over an interval \([a, b]\) is defined as:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                \int_a^b f(x) \, dg(x)
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, \( g \) is a monotonic function that induces a measure, allowing integration to incorporate various types of probability distributions.
            </p>

            <h3>Applications in Probability Theory</h3>
            <p>
                In probability theory, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral provides a unified framework for defining expectations and computing probabilities. 
                For example, the expected value of a random variable \( X \) with a cumulative distribution function (CDF) \( F(x) \) is given by:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x \, dF(x)
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                This formulation seamlessly integrates both discrete and continuous random variables. Additionally, probabilities of events can be calculated using this integral, making it a fundamental tool in stochastic modeling and probability analysis.
            </p>

            <h3>Applications in Measure Theory</h3>
            <p>
                In measure theory, Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration establishes a formal link between integration and measures, providing a rigorous foundation for advanced mathematical analysis. 
                It extends integration to functions that may be difficult to handle using Riemann integration, such as those defined over irregular domains or containing discontinuities. 
                This framework is essential for defining and analyzing measures, allowing precise mathematical descriptions of complex structures.
            </p>

            <p>
                Overall, Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration plays a vital role in modern probability and measure theory, offering a powerful and flexible approach to mathematical modeling and analysis.
