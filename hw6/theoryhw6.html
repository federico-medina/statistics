            <h1>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC)</h1>

            <p>
                The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) establishes a fundamental link between differentiation and integration, 
                providing a method to evaluate definite integrals using antiderivatives. This theorem is particularly important in 
                probability theory, where it explains the relationship between probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative 
                distribution functions (CDFs) for continuous random variables.
            </p>

            <h2>Two Parts of the FTC</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>First Part:</strong> If \( F(x) \) is defined as the integral of a continuous function \( f(t) \) from \( a \) to \( x \):
                    \[
                    F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt,
                    \]
                    then \( F(x) \) is differentiable, and its derivative is \( f(x) \):
                    \[
                    F'(x) = f(x).
                    \]
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Second Part:</strong> If \( f(x) \) is continuous on an interval \([a, b]\), then its definite integral can be evaluated as:
                    \[
                    \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a),
                    \]
                    where \( F(x) \) is any antiderivative of \( f(x) \), meaning \( F'(x) = f(x) \).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Application to Probability: PDFs and CDFs</h2>

            <p>
                The FTC plays a crucial role in probability theory, particularly in understanding the relationship between PDFs 
                and CDFs for continuous random variables.
            </p>

            <h2>Definitions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Probability Density Function (PDF):</strong>  
                    The PDF \( f(x) \) represents the likelihood of a continuous random variable \( X \) taking values near \( x \).  
                    While the PDF itself is not a probability, it describes the rate at which probability accumulates over \( x \).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):</strong>  
                    The CDF \( F(x) \) gives the probability that \( X \) is less than or equal to \( x \):
                    \[
                    F(x) = \mathbb{P}(X \leq x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(t) \, dt.
                    \]
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Connecting PDFs and CDFs Using the FTC</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Since \( F(x) \) is defined as the integral of \( f(t) \) from \( -\infty \) to \( x \), it is differentiable if \( f(x) \) is continuous.
                </li>
                <li>
                    By the first part of the FTC, the derivative of \( F(x) \) gives the PDF:
                    \[
                    F'(x) = f(x).
                    \]
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This result is fundamental in probability theory, as it shows that the PDF describes the rate at which the cumulative 
                probability (from \( -\infty \) to \( x \)) increases at each point \( x \).
            </p>

            <h2>Example</h2>

            <p>Consider a continuous random variable \( X \) with the PDF:</p>

            \[
            f(x) = \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac{|x|}{2}},
            \]

            which corresponds to an exponential distribution centered at zero.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    The CDF for \( x \geq 0 \) is:
                    \[
                    F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac{|t|}{2}} \, dt.
                    \]
                </li>
                <li>
                    Differentiating \( F(x) \) with respect to \( x \) gives back the PDF:
                    \[
                    F'(x) = f(x) = \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac{|x|}{2}}.
                    \]
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                This example demonstrates how the probability density function describes the rate of change of the cumulative 
                distribution function, directly linking the two through the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
