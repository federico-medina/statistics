            <h2 id="chapter1">Basic notions in Statistics</h2>
            <h3 id="chapter1.1">Statistical Units</h3>
            <p>A statistical unit refers to the entity for which data is collected and statistics are generated. This could be an observation unit, which is the specific person or object from which information is obtained and measured, or an analytical unit, which is constructed by statisticians. Analytical units are formed by splitting or merging observation units, using estimation or imputation techniques, to provide more detailed or consistent data than what would be available directly from observation units.<br /><br />An observation unit is the individual or object on which measurements are made. It is also known as a case, subject (when it involves a person), or experimental unit in research contexts.<br /><br />Analytical units, on the other hand, are created by statisticians to refine or adjust the data, often by breaking down or combining observation units to achieve more precise or uniform datasets.</p>
            <h3 id="chapter1.2">Population</h3>
            <p>In statistics, the population refers to a group or set of items, individuals, or data points representing a common characteristic and being of interest in a statistical study. It includes all the possible observations or measurements that could be made about the phenomenon of interest.<br />
            One example could be, if you are studying the average weight of adults in a country, then the population would include all adults in that country.<br />
            As it is always impractical to collect data on an entire population, most research involves studying a sample, or subset of a population, and using statistical methods to make inferences about an entire population.</p>
            <h3 id="chapter1.3">Distribution</h3>
            <p>Distribution, in statistical perception, refers to the pattern of variation of values  taken by a random variable over the range of possible values. Essentially, it describes the probabilities of occurrences of different values, or the frequency of such observations within the dataset or population.<br /><br />Some of the important features of distribution include:<br />Probability Distribution: This describes the distribution of probabilities that are assigned to each value of a discrete random variable or to intervals of a continuous random variable. Examples commonly include the normal distribution, binomial distribution, and Poisson distribution.<br /><br />
            Shape: This could be symmetric, skewed, uniform, and bell-shaped, among others. The shape of the distribution gets at the nature of the data; whether it is tightly packed around a central value or dispersed.<br />Central Tendency: These are the measures that include but are not limited to mean, median, and mode and define where the center of the distribution lies.<br />Dispersion: This is the measure of spread that tells how much values deviate; conventionally, it is computed by range, variance, and standard deviation.<br /><br />In sum, understanding the distribution about data is crucial in drawing inferences, making predictions, and basing decisions on statistical analysis.</p>
            <h3 id="chapter1.4">Frequency (relative, absolute, percentage)</h3>
            <p>Frequency, in statistics, is the number of times a given value or category occurs in a set of data. In itself, frequency is a way of summarizing and analyzing data by tabulating the number of items in a dataset falling into different values. Frequency generally comes in three major types.<br />Absolute Frequency: The frequency of occurrence of a certain value or category of a grouping within a set. So, if the number "5" occurs three times in a dataset, it is said that its absolute frequency is 3.<br /><br />Relative Frequency: It is the relationship of the total number of observations that falls into a particular value or category. Estimation is done by dividing the absolute frequency of such a value by the total number of observations. For example, if there is a total of 30 observations and such an absolute frequency of value "5" is 3, then the relative frequency is 3/30=0.1 or 10%.<br /><br />Percentage Frequency: It is the relative frequency expressed as a percentage. It is calculated by multiplying the relative frequency by 100. Taking the same example again, the corresponding percentage frequency of the value "5" would be 0.1x100=10% .<br /><br />These are some of the measures of frequency that help in describing the distribution of data and hence indicate trends to compare different values or categories.</p><br />
            <h2 id="chapter2">Notion of Arithmetic</h2>
            <h3 id="chapter2.1">Arithmetic average</h3>
            <p>It provides the arithmetic average, or often just average, a way to describe the central tendency of a set by using the mean of a set of numbers. The arithmetic mean is calculated by adding together all values in a dataset and dividing it by the number of values.<br /><br />The formula for the arithmetic average is:<br /><p>$$\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}$$</p><br />Where:<br />Key Points: The arithmetic average is sensitive to extreme values or outliers that may exist in a distribution, which can pull the mean in a certain direction.<br />Because it is simple to summarize a dataset, it finds broad applications in finance, economics, and the social sciences.<br />Arithmetic average can only be calculated for numerical data.</p>
            <h3 id="chapter2.2">Derivation</h3>
            <p>Derivation in statistics is a crucial process that underpins the development and validation of mathematical concepts, formulas, and theories used in data analysis. It involves applying mathematical and logical techniques to derive meaningful conclusions from established axioms, definitions, and theorems.<br /><br />In statistics, derivation often encompasses the exploration of fundamental concepts such as the mean, variance, and probability distribution, ensuring that each formula is constructed on a strong theoretical basis.</p>
            <h3 id="chapter2.3">Computational problems with floating point rapresentation</h3>
            <p>In computing, numbers are often represented using floating-point arithmetic, a system that approximates real numbers within the limitations of computer hardware. However, this approach introduces rounding errors and precision limitations, which can result in significant inaccuracies in certain calculations.<br /><br />Floating-point representation allows for the expression of both extremely large and extremely small numbers. However, since the available bits for storing precision and scaling factors are limited, some real numbers cannot be represented exactly, leading to rounding errors. These errors can accumulate over time, causing discrepancies in computations.<br /><br />One particularly problematic issue is catastrophic cancellation, which occurs when subtracting two nearly identical values. In such cases, most of the significant digits cancel out, leaving behind only less precise digits. This loss of accuracy can result in unreliable numerical results.</p>
            <h3 id="chapter2.4">Numerical Solution</h3>
            <p>In statistics, a numerical solution refers to the use of computational methods to approximate statistical measures, probabilities, or model parameters when exact analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to derive. These methods are essential for handling complex datasets, solving equations that lack closed-form solutions, and estimating parameters in statistical models.<br /><br />Common numerical techniques in statistics include iterative optimization algorithms (such as Newton-Raphson and gradient descent), Monte Carlo simulations, numerical integration, and bootstrapping. These methods are widely used in areas such as maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and hypothesis testing.<br /><br />While numerical solutions provide practical approximations, they are influenced by factors such as rounding errors, convergence rates, and computational efficiency. Proper validation and error analysis are crucial to ensure accurate and reliable statistical results.</p>
